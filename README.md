# Super-resolution actin and mitochondria analysis
Image analysis for MitoTracker and Phalloidin staining in Zeiss Airyscan super resolution microscopy images.  
[This repository](https://github.com/gerencserlab/Superresolution-actin-and-mitochondria-analysis/) contains custom image analysis pipelines  for Image Analyst MKII, used in the following publication: currently under embargo    

## List of pipelines
